* From the MCS6500 Family Hardware Manual:
  > The timing of all data transfers is controlled by the system clock. The clock itself is actually
two non-overlapping square waves. This two-phase clock system can best be thought of as two alternating
positive-going pulses. This text will refer to the clocks as Phase One and Phase Two. A Phase One
clock pulse is the positive pulse during which the address lines change and a Phase Two clock pulse
is the positive pulse during which the data is transferred. The timing of the signals on the Address Bus,
Data Bus, and R/W line are shown in Figures 1.5 through 1.8... In particular, the address lines and
the R/W line will stabilize during Phase One, and all data transfers will take place during Phase Two.
